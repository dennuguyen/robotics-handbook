## Gears

### Module

Meshing gears must have the same module.

$$
M = \frac{d}{N}
$$

### Gear Ratio

$$
\eta = \frac{N_{driven}}{N_{driving}}
$$

### Driving

Gearing can be considered if the selection of motors is limited. Typically, purchased motors have high RPM that can be geared down to output your desired torque.

### Design for Gear Ratio with Max Motor Torque Constraint

$$
\eta = \frac{T_{min}}{T_{max}}
$$
